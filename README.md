## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

At first, it was difficult to know what CSS properties I should apply to my project in order for the QR card to be displayed exactly the way the design is pictured. 

It was fun to match the design and I have a better understanding of what properties are needed, and what aren't. I ended up removing a lot of excess styling and simplified the stylesheet.

### Continued development

I want to have a better grasp on CSS fundamentals, and continue to create more components that are responsive and accessible.
